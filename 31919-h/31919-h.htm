<span class="i0">Bland glow-worm glamours warm and dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the mystic vistas swim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, 'round the fountain's oozy urn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limp, loose fronds of limber fern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wave dusky tresses thin and wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue-filleted with violet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er roots that writhe in snaky knots<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The affluent wild rose flowers rank;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Turn all the life beneath to death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rottenness for their own breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May-apples waxen-stemmed and large<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their bloom-screening breadths of targe;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His thyrsus there, and so had lost.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The red life of its mother's womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all its ardent pulses fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beating in scarlet veins of wine.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From cool, clay banks of cressy streams,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And hot as some sultana's breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With turbulent passions or with death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A haze of floating saffron; sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shy, crisp creepings o'er the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dip and stir of twig and leaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempestuous gusts of spices brief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From elder bosks and sassafras;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wind-cuffs that dodge the laughing grass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp, sudden songs and whisperings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hint at untold hidden things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pan and Sylvanus that of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept sacred each wild wood and wold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wily light beneath the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quivers and dusks with ev'ry breeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mayhap some Hamadryad who,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Culling her morning meal of dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From frail accustomed cups of flowers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some Satyr watching through the bowers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had, when his goat hoof snapped and pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brittle branch, shrunk back distressed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bathing her limbs one instant there.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On southern winds shot through with amber light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breeding soft balm, and clothed in cloudy white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lily-fingered Spring came o'er the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waking the crocus and the daffodils.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the cold earth she breathed a tender sigh,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maples sang and flung their banners high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their crimson-tasseled pennons, and the elm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound his dark brows with a green-crested helm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the musky rot of Autumn's leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the forest's myriad naked eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life woke and rose in gold and green and blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robed in the star-light of the twinkling dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With timid tread adown the barren wood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">White-mantled Winter wagging his white head,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I'll strangle thee tho' thou be welcomer thrice!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her sainted throat of snow, he coiled and crossed,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And cast her on the dark, unfeeling mold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tender blossoms, blighted in the fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her warm bosoms, trembling bowed their brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In holy meekness, or in scattered rows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huddled about her white and silent feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on pale lips laid fond last kisses sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died: lilacs all musky for the May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bluer violets, and snow drops lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent and dead, but yet divinely fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ice gems glist'ning in Spring's lovely hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Beautiful, so innocent, sweet, and pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why must thou perish, and the evil still endure?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too soon must pass the Beautiful away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too long doth Terror hold anarchal sway!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! sad heart, bow not beneath the pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time changeth all, the Beautiful wakes again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We can not question such; a higher power<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo! where the car of Day down slopes of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On burnished axle quits the drowsy skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as his snorting steeds of glowing brass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush 'neath the earth, a glimmering dust of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their fierce hoofs o'er heaven's azure meads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls to yon star that burns beneath the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With solemn tread and holy-stoled, star-bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Night steps in, sad votaress, like a nun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pace lone corridors of th' ebon-arch&eacute;d sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sad! how beautiful! her raven locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale-filleted with stars that dance their sheen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her deep, holy eyes, and woo to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep or the easeful slumber of white Death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How calm o'er this great water, in its flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent and vast, smoothes yon cold sister sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lucid chasteness feathering the wax-white foam!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As o'er a troubled brow falls calm content:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As clear-eyed chastity in this bleak world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tinges and softens all the darker dross.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">See, where the roses blow at the wood's edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many a languid bloom, bowed to the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dim river's lisp; sleep droops their lids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With damask lashes trimmed and fragile rayed,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which the mad, frolic bee&mdash;rough paramour&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So often kissed beneath th' enlivening sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How cool the breezes touch the tired head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unseen fingers long and soft! and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its white couch of thorn-tree blossoms sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pillowed with one milk cluster, floating, swooning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drops the low nocturne of a dreaming bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ave Maria</i>, nun-like, slumb'ring sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, there the violet mound in many an eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deep-blue eye, meek, delicate, and sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Sorrow's own sad eyes, great with far dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When haltingly she bends o'er Lethe's waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falt'ring to drink, and falt'ring still remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Night with feet of moon-tinged mist swept o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them now, but as she passed she bent and kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each modest orb that selfless hung as tho'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought-freighted low; then groped her train of jet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which billowing by did merely waft the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a brief gust to each wild violet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kiss each eye and laugh; then shed a tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon each downward face which nestled there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She weeping from her silent vigil turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some pale mother from her cradled child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail, sick, and wan, with kisses warm and songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wooed to a peaceful ease and tranquil rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the rathe cock crows to the graying East.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mayhap they've seen the guardian Genius lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At its dark bottom in an oozy cave<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That there once stood an isle as rich and fair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And while the deep flamingo colored West<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Plucked yestere'en from its dead mate's gray wing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It falling, gasping at its moccasined feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its wild life breathed away, while the glad brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whooped to the sunset, and yon faint blue hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered his exultation with a whoop.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Between dim sylvan isles, a happy two.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All mystic in its mist, the soft gale bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Siren's song, while on the ghostly steeps<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thick-powdered, pallid, or like urns of blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dripping, and blowing from wide mouths of blooms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On our bare brows cool gales of sweet perfumes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from the yellow stars that splashed the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er our light shallop dropped soft mysteries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of calm and sleep, until the yellower moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose full of fire above a dark lagoon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she rose the nightingales on sprays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heavy, shadowy roses burst in praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her wild loveliness, with boisterous pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailing far off around a ruined fane.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'round our lazy keel that dipped to swing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirits of the foam came whispering;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And from dank Neptune's coral-columned caves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the Oceanids rise thro' the waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw their smooth limbs cold-glimmering in the spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumultuous bosoms panting with their play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their oozy tresses, tossed unto the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash sea-green brightness o'er the tumbled seas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid columned isles, glance vaguely thro' the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We watched the Satyrs chase the Dryades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard Pan's fierce trebles and the Triton's horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sound from the rock-lashed foam when rose the Morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With chilly fingers dewing all the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blushed for love and closed their starry eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Naiad saw sweet smiling, in white mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half hidden in a bay of amethyst<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Oread in cincture of green vines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One twinkling foot half buried in the red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a deep dimpled, crumpled poppy bed&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Faint clouds that with the sunset colors glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slip down in scarlet o'er its crystal white,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her wine-red lips half-parted in surprise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wanton Faun with furry, pointed ears.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stays her fair band, the stag hounds' clamor stills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already nearer glow the Oread's charms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seize them Faunus strains his hairy arms&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A senseless statue of white, weeping stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills his embrace; the Oread is gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stag-hounds bay, Dian resumes the chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the astonished Faun's bewildered face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paints all his wonderment, and, wondering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bends above the sculpture of the spring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We sailed; and many a morn of breathing balm,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With the fair myths below, our God above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sail in golden sunsets and emerge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In golden morns upon a fretless surge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah, alas! the stars that dot the blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine not alway; the clouds must gather too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew not how it came, but in a while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself I found cast on an arid isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone and barkless, soaked and wan with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seas in wrath and thunder overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep down in coral caverns my pale love,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A vast, still Heaven of unremembered dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, lawny lengths of perishable cloud<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Clouds raining colors, gold and violet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Down hints of mystic beauty and old charms<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Down which it seemed a hundred torrent rills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed leaping silver, vines and vines and vines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of purple vintage swollen with cool wines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale pleasant wines and fragrant as the June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their delicate life robbed from the foam-fair moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the clouds o'er this sweet world there dripp'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An odorous music strange and feverish lipped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swung and swooned and panted in mad sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invoking at each wave sad rapturous eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of limpid, willowy beings fair as night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decked spangly with crisp flower-like stars of white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim honeyed booming of the boisterous bee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In purple myriads of faint fleurs-de-lis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of surf far-foaming on forgotten strands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of immemorial seas in fairy lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of melting passion, who, with crimson lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many shells laid to each swell that dips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sigh secret hope of unrequited love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In murmurous language to wan winds above.<br /></span>
